# Appending to i3status - Stefan Bruenig (http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3status/tree/contrib/measure-net-speed-i3status.bash)
#
# Usage notes: replace i3status with the location of this file in your i3 config file, like so:
# bar {
#   status_command i3status
# }
#
# becomes
#
# bar {
#   status_command ~/.config/i3/i3status_with_prepend_data.bash
# }


eval data_script="~/.config/i3status/i3status_prepend_data_generator.bash"





# data_script must print to std out a string with the following properties:
# 	valid json with only {} characters (no [])
#	have a "full_text" field
#	end with comma
#	multiple messages formatted as "{msg1},{msg2}," etc.
#
# Example String 1:
# {"name":"test_property","color":"00FF00","full_text":"TEST PASS"},
#
# Example String 2:
# {"full_text":"Hello "},{"full_text":"World!"},
#
# (Please note that Example String 2 would print as "Hello |World!" in the i3bar)
